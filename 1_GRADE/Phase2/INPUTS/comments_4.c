// This is just a really long, single-line comment. Like, comically long.  Here's some text from the specs just to pad things out a bit more. When executed with a mode of 1, your compiler should read the specified input file and divide it into tokens; essentially this is the lexical analysis phase of the compiler (referred to as the “lexer”). The output stream should contain a line for each token, showing the file name, line number, and text corresponding to the token. More details (including the precise output and error formats, and the definitions for the tokens) are given below. The input file may be a C header file, a C source file, or an arbitrary text file. There are opportunities for extra credit.  All implementation must be C, C++, or Java. Instructor permission is required to use anything beyond the standard libraries for these languages. Submissions will be graded on pyrite.cs.iastate.edu, and therefore must build and run correctly there.  Students are strongly encouraged to encapsulate the functionality of this phase of the compiler, so that later parts of the project can easily examine and consume tokens from an input stream. Your lexer must recognize the tokens given in Table 1. A useful list of integer constants for tokens may be found in tokens.h, distributed with the materials for this part of the project. Note that single-character symbols use their ASCII codes; all other tokens have integer values above 300. Whitespace (spaces, tabs, and carriage returns) serves only to separate tokens, and should otherwise be discarded. Any characters that are not part of a lexeme, such as $, should generate an error message.  You may notice that some of the C keywords and operators are missing. Students are welcome to implement additional language features if desired, but any extra keywords or operators must be part ot the C standard. Be sure to commit your source code and documentation to your git repository, and to upload (push) those commits to the server so that we may grade them. In Canvas, indicate if you would like us to re-grade your part 0 submission for reduced credit, or only grade part 1. If nothing is indicated, we will grade part 1 only. I guess that's enough, right?  No point making it even longer?  Fine.
